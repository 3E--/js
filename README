-- DESCRIPTION --

js is a JavaScript interpreter based on Google's V8 (http://code.google.com/apis/v8/).

Aside from being an interpreter, the aim is to provide a general-purpose standard library for JavaScript applications living outside web browsers.

The code has only been tested on Mac OS X, but should work without hassle on all POSIX-compliant platforms.

-- INSTRUCTIONS --

1) Download and build V8 as per the instructions found here: http://code.google.com/apis/v8/build.html

2) Build js: g++ -o js -I/path/to/v8/include /path/to/libv8.a *.cpp

3) Run your JavaScript files with ./js yourfile.js.

-- HELLO WORLD --

Example:

#!./js
load("prelude.js");
println("Hello World!");

-- BASIC I/O --

#!./js
load("prelude.js");
var file = IO.open("prelude.js");
while (!file.eof) {
	IO.stdout.write(file.read(100));
}

-- AUTHORS --

V8 is made by the fabulous engineers over at Google, led by Lars Bak.

The current version of js is written by Simon Ask Ulsnes.
