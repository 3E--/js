TODO
====

* I/O library should support binary data. Currently, the String classes of V8 mangle binary data, so separate classes suitable for raw data should be used by the I/O methods.

* File I/O is incomplete. Missing: file creation, touch, tmpfile, etc. Goal: Support any file operation in stdio.h.

* A socket interface.

* A process control interface (fork etc.).

* How does V8 fare with threads? If it can handle multiple threads in a context, pthread support would be interesting.
